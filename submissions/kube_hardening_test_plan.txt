## Kubernetes Hardening Test Plan

When hardening a Kubernetes cluster, it's crucial to ensure that security changes do not harm system stability.

### How will you test the changes?

- **Staging Environment:**
Apply all changes first to a staging cluster that closely matches production. This helps catch problems before they reach users.
- **Automated Tests:**
Run automated integration and regression tests after every change to verify that applications and cluster services still work as expected.
- **Manual Checks:**
Manually verify that key workloads can start, network communication works, and users can access necessary services.
- **Performance Testing**
Get traffic from production system and apply it to test cluster to test that the system can handle the load.


### How will you ensure the changes donâ€™t negatively affect your cluster?

- **Monitoring and Alerts:**
Use monitoring tools (like Prometheus) to watch cluster health and performance before and after changes.
- **Gradual Rollouts:**
Deploy changes in small steps (canary or blue/green deployments) and monitor the impact at each stage.
- **Rollback Plan:**
Always have a tested rollback procedure ready so you can quickly undo changes if something goes wrong.
- **Communication:**
Keep all teams informed about changes and document results for future reference.
