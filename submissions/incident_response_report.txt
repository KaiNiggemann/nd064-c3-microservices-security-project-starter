1. Incident commander name:
Kai Niggemann

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched.
This was detected by Falco system monitoring.

3. Summary of what was affected:
Kubernetes cluster was affected.

4. Summmry of the impact:
Increased CPU and memory utilization leading to increased costs
lowering the performance and stability of the whole cluster at 
the same time.
The crypto miners also increase the attack surface by having
their own security flaws.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The administrator noticed the event through Grafana monitoring and evicted the pods.
Access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards was restricted. 
Admission controllers have been configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Access restrictions to the kubernetes cluster have been too low and must be configured more strict in future
for every (new) cluster.
Hardening of a cluster should be validated automatically, e.g. by using Kube-bench.
