Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
* Information Disclosure / Tampering: Getting access to host files for untrusted users member of the docker group (see risk chap. 1.2.2)
* Information Disclosure: Restrict network traffic between containers on the same host (see risk chap. 2.1)
* Tampering: Allows container execution interruption if parameter live-restore is not set (see risk chap. 2.13)
* Tampering: Enabled userland proxy increases the attack surface (see risk chap. 2.14)
* Elevation of Privilege: Additional privileges can be acquired, if no_new_priv is not set (see risk chap. 2.17)

Kubernetes Threat Modeling

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
